<p>SIP Hawaii is a family owned and operated One-Stop e-commerce business located in Waikiki - Honolulu. Founded in July 2007. Operating from and registered in the state of Hawaii.

We are happy and proud "presenting The Isles' Best" products at down to earth prices. Reasons that our products are so reasonably priced is that we don't waste money on fancy overhead costs and by borrowing from the banks, but by streamlining with suppliers that understand the needs of small business, being efficient and by doing all our web site design in-house, - expenses that would have to be passed along to our customers.

We are specialized in Hawaiian and Royal Kona coffees Fresh from Hawaii, Hawaiian Islands Teas, Chocolate Macadamia nuts, Island Foods, Natural Dietary Supplements, Island Music and Scenic DVD's video, Bath Body products, Gifts and Souvenirs.


We've built up a strong following of customers, with international testimonials. Many of them are amazed at the competitive prices and the speed that with we deliver.</p>


<h4>Why is our business not advertised locally?</h4>

<p>The answer is we are a family business and very down-home and low-key. We believe that if you treat customers well with fair prices and good friendly service, supplementing relevant information, those customers will tell their friends about our site, and will continue to be good customers themselves.
